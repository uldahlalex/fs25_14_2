## Mermaid charts for common fullstack operations

In the following directory: `https://github.com/uldahlalex/fs25_14_2/tree/master/assets/diagrams`
You can find charts that describe the flow of data in a fullstack application. They can help you understand the general flow of data and how different components interact with each other.

Github can display these mermaid Charts like this: (with controls in the bottom right of each chart)

## Example codebase:

You can view the code for the weather station here:

`https://github.com/uldahlalex/fs25_14_2`

Or use the deployed app here *(with 7 second cold start for the server app, so just refresh if the deployment has been inactive)*: 

`https://easvweatherstation.web.app`


## Rules for exam:

Q) What is the flow of communication between client and server when using WebSockets?

Q) Who has to be the one initiating the connection (server or client?)

Q) How do you make sure certain clients receive a broadcast from the server?
