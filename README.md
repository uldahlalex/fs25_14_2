## Today's Activity: Problem Description for Exam Project
**Task:** Meet with your group (1 person groups are also viable). Figure out what your exam project should be.
Here are my general guidelines:
- Since you are free to pick any project, you should prioritize a project which benefits from the technologies used (Websockets and onion architecture must be used).
- Pick something where a "minimum viable product" / walking skeleton / usable demo is doable with a 6 week scope or less.
    - If the minimum viable product is reached before the submission date, it is preferable if certain features can be added / polished.


**You don't need to submit your exam project description or groups, but it is important that you prepare a description.**

If you're unsure whether or not your idea is doable / viable / relevant, please ask me (and possibly also the other elective course teachers if it is a multi-subject product).
