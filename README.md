## Topics
- Info about Exam + Q&A
- Deployment revisit (with MQTT & Ping)
- Connection manager revisit

## Slides
- Link: (coming soon)

## Today's materials:
The code examples from the presentation slides can be found in today's repo's directory *"template_onion_with_mqtt"* **(new connection manager, deployment stuff, pinging, etc.)** 
The codebase is a Weather Station app. (Notice that the workflows for the weather station app are defined in the root for today's lesson folder and not in the "solution folder")

## Today's Activity 1: Problem Description for Exam Project
**Task:** Meet with your group (1 person groups are also viable). Figure out what your exam project should be.
Here are my general guidelines:
- Since you are free to pick any project, you should prioritize a project which benefits from the technologies used (Websockets and onion architecture must be used).
- Pick something where a "minimum viable product" / walking skeleton / usable demo is doable with a 6 week scope or less.
    - If the minimum viable product is reached before the submission date, it is preferable if certain features can be added / polished.


**You don't need to submit your exam project description or groups, but it is important that you prepare a description.**

If you're unsure whether or not your idea is doable / viable / relevant, please ask me (and possibly also the other elective course teachers if it is a multi-subject product).
